Computer engineering is the branch of engineering that integrates electronic engineering with computer sciences. 
Computer engineers design and develop computer systems and other technological devices. 
Most computer engineering jobs require at least a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. 
Many employers also require state certification as a professional engineer (PE). 
A master's degree is often required for promotion to management, and ongoing education and training are needed to keep up with advances in technology.
